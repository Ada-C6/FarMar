# FarMar::Product

# Each product belongs to a vendor. The vendor_id field refers to the FarMar::Vendor ID field. The FarMar::Product data, in order in the CSV, consists of:

# ID - (Fixnum) uniquely identifies the product
# Name - (String) the name of the product (not guaranteed unique)
# Vendor_id - (Fixnum) a reference to which vendor sells this product

# For each of the data classes build the following methods:

# self.all: returns a collection of instances, representing all of the objects described in the CSV
# self.find(id): returns an instance of the object where the value of the id field in the CSV matches the passed parameter.

# Additional FarMar::Product Methods
